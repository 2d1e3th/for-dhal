You don’t have to perform or pretend. I just want you to know that you are seen, exactly as you are—with all the sadness and the anger and the exhaustion. <br><br> " +

I’m so glad we met, and it doesn't matter to me if you don't recognize me in person or that I only exist to you on the internet; our connection is real to me, and you have made a genuine impact on my life.<br><br>" +

Like a long Pokémon journey, there are levels that feel impossible to beat and caves that feel too dark to navigate, but I don't want to reach the next stage without you. I’m already looking forward to the day you feel up to it so we can play together again. <br><br>" +
